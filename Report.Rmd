# Introduction

This report provides a detailed analysis of the Shiny app developed for cricket player ODI data . The app is designed to allow users to interact with cricket data in a user-friendly manner, providing insights into player performance, team statistics, match simulations, and more.

## App Overview

The Shiny app consists of several tabs, each dedicated to a specific aspect of cricket analysis. This section provides an overview of each tab's purpose and functionality.

## Player ODI Data

This tab allows users to explore individual player statistics for One Day International (ODI) matches. Users can select a country, choose a player, and specify whether they want to view batting or bowling statistics.

-   **Country Selection**: Users can choose a country from a dropdown menu.

-   **Player Selection**: Once a country is selected, users can choose a player from a dynamically generated list of players for that country.

-   **Batting/Bowling Selection**: Users can select whether they want to view batting or bowling statistics.

-   **Player Image**: An image of the selected player is displayed.

-   **Player Data Table**: Detailed statistics of the selected player are presented in a table format. This will be like:-

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
library(dplyr)
load("Cricket.Rdata")
Player_Data$India$`Virat Kohli`$Batting[2]
```

-   **Player Performance Plot**: A plot visualizing the player's performance is displayed. Like this :-

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
Player_Data$India$`Virat Kohli`$Batting[3]
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
data <- Cricket_Match(Player_Data$Afghanistan,Player_Data$India,Player_name$Afghanistan,Player_name$India)
data
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
 p <-  ggplot(data[[1]][[1]], aes(x = batsman_name, y = Runs, col = factor(four), size = six , shape = batsman_outer)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        labs(title ="Batsman Performance" ,x = "Batsman Name", y = "Total Runs", 
             shape = "Wicketeer", color = "No of Four", size = "No of Six") +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),legend.position = "none")
      ggplotly(p, tooltip = c("batsman_name", "Runs", "four", "six", "batsman_outer"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
  ggplot(data[[1]][[2]], aes(x = "", y = Runs, fill = Baller_name)) +
        geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
        geom_text(aes(label = paste(Baller_name, "\n", "Wickets:", Wicket,"\n","Runs:" , Runs)), 
                  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3, vjust = 1, color = "white") +
        coord_polar("y") +
        theme_minimal() +  # Change the theme to minimal
        theme(
          legend.position = "none",
          axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove x-axis text
          panel.grid = element_blank(),   # Remove grid lines
          plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"),  # Change plot background color
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),     # Change panel background color
          axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),           # Add a border around the plot
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),   # Center the title and increase font size
          axis.title = element_text(size = 1),                # Increase axis label font size
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)    )            # Increase y-axis text font size
```
