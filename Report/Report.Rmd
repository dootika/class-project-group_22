## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 About Cricket

What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear, see the word "CRICKET"?

We probably think about cricket match so we decided to make a a shiny app that takes two teams and gives us the result of the match .

### 1.2 Project Motivation & Objective

We are motivated by the craze of cricket , World Cup are going on and we see the match and thought come in mind that what happen if in a team one or two player are changed , what will be the probablity of winning , So based of previous data we decided to make a function that will do our job .

### 1.3 Questions We Imposed

Here are a few questions laid down by us looking at the dataset:

-   What level of control and customization is available during the match simulation?

-   Can we get a visual representations of data using graphs and chart?

-   Can we filter match history by specific teams, years, or tournaments?

-   Are historical statistics and records available for past World Cup tournaments?

-   Can we view a team's recent performance statistics, such as recent form and trends?

-   What is the correlation between a country's performance and its GDP and its Happiness index?

-   How can we access a summary of each previous encounter between two sides in the app?

-   Is there a feature to watch or re-enact classic matches from the past?

-   Can we find the win-loss ratio for different countries participating in the ODI World Cup?

-   Can we choose between default teams or create a custom team with my favorite players?

## 2. About our Dataset

### 2.1 Source and method of obtaining dataset

We scraped the players data from a website called [Cricmetric](http://www.cricmetric.com/index.py), and Teams data from [Cricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/list-of-match-results-by-year-307851).
The GDP per Capital data was initially downloaded from - [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zgrcemta/world-gdpgdp-gdp-per-capita-and-annual-growths?select=gdp_per_capita.csv). It is cleaned to be used with the dataset collected.
The Happiness Index data was downloaded from - [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simonaasm/world-happiness-index-by-reports-2013-2023/?select=World+Happiness+Index+by+Reports+2013-2023+with+nulls.csv).

### 2.2 Describing datsaset variables

The datasets we obtained was having data of all the ODI cricket player of all the teams that players of had played ODI matches, we selected those player which are playing now because we got the list of player of ODI team of every country that have ODI team.

#### 2.2.1 Categorical Variables

Player_name

:   Contains the name of playes according to country and saved as a list .

Country_name

:   Contains the names of country witch are interested in ODI means have ODI teams and are going to play ODI matched .

All_Player_name

:   Contain same as Player name but in different manner this have player name in simple way means as a vector .

#### 2.2.2 Numerical Variables

All_Player_Data

:   This variable is a list witch contains 147 list whose names are according to Player names and in each list scraped data is stored . We scraph data in form of a tibble and computed probablity of from that and and also a visualsation plot and store all these in a list means in list that is of player name contaion all these three things .

coord

:   Contains the coordinated of world by this we will plot the world map and show some visualisation on it .

gdp

:   This is a data set which have row names as country name and columns have years and have gdp per capita of the country in that year in it.

happy

:   This is a dataset which have row as country name and columns have year, rank and happiness index data in it.

image_links

:   This is a list in this there are 10 list named after country name and in each there are 15 list which have name before player name and in this image ink is stored .

Player_Data

:   Is a list contain the data which is same as All_Player_data but saved according to country names.

table

:   This is a table which contains data of all ODI Matches played, Winner, Loser, Winning Score, Losing Score, Winning Innings, Margin, Ground, Date.

## 3. How did we obtain our dataset? (Scraping it is!)

### 3.1 Libraries we used in this process

-   rvest

-   tidyverse

### 3.2 Problems we faced in this process

The main problem is that when we scrap the player name and in **Crickmetric** website we put a player name and it says no data because there is a spell mistake in the name and on other website same happens with different player name.

The main problem with scraping on **Cricinfo** is that we got the winner, loser, date, ground and margin of each match easily in the form of a table which can be scraped easily, but getting the match scores was a bit more tricky. For good plots, we only consider matches which give a result(No draws or ties).



### 3.3 Solutions we used to tackle the aforementioned issues

So after scraping we cross check the names of a player manually, after getting the correct name we formed the list and makes a function the scrap the data a give input as a player name and takes output the dataset of the past years.
For getting the scores of the teams, we had to go to the link of the scorecard for each match, and scrape that site separately for the match scores.

## 4. Cleaning the Dataset

### 4.1 Libraries we used in this process

-   dplyr

-   stringr

### 4.2 Method, problems and their solutions while cleaning data

#### 4.2.1 Player Data

When we see all payer are now matching with the website player name then after checking 2-3 player name we see the the data which website is showing is in same way so we deside to form a function that will scraph al the data , the cleaning of data will also present in th function , the main problem is that the NA values are generting in cleaning process becouse of some sign , we use gsum , sub , substering, sapply , etc functions to clean the data

#### 4.2.2 Categorizing numeric into category

All the data we get from the website is in formet of character so we convert all the data in numeric category . so that we can use it in visualisation .

#### 4.2.3 Functions that are user defined and used in scraping

#### 4.2.3.1 Scrap_Bowling_data(Player name)

This function takes the player name and then from web site scrap the data and clean it and also calculationg the probability of Bowler players to take witcket and also visulaise the data and combine in a list and give this list as output.

#### 4.2.3.1 Scrap_Bating_data(Player name)

This function takes the player name and then from web site scrap the data and clean it and also calculating the proability of players to hit runs and also visualise the data and combine in a list and give this list as output.

#### 4.2.4 Function to get ODI Data for a particular team

We use the function team_filter(team_name) to filter out the ODI Matches played by that team, and it gives out the scores made by that team, the opponent, winner, loser, scores made by the winner, the loser, match date, ground, and margin of victory.

## 5. Cricket Function that simulated the match :

This function takes four input two are player name and two are player data , based of probability of players the results are calculated, this is the code :

```{r}

## 5.0 Visualising the Dataset

### 5.1 Libraries we used in this process

-   ggplot2

-   imager

-   rvest

-   ggpubr

-   ggthemes

-   tidyverse

-   reshape2

### 5.2 Generating plot with the help of user defined functions

#### 5.2.1 Function: All_Player_data$...$....\$[[3]]

In this plot there are two coloured bars , rech are marked in right side of plot anyone can easily understand, the text on red coloured bar is of strike rate in that year and text on blue coloured bar shows the rate that player out means in 1 inning what will be the probablity of player to br out is there.

#### 5.2.2 Function: imager(link of image )

This function plot the image of the player by using the link .

### 5.3 Shiny app

The Shiny App made by our group had the following features:

-   ODI Player data tab in this tab viewer have to give input as a country name and player name and player data will be shown

    ![](images/C__Users_indra_Downloads_class-project-group_22-main_class-project-group_22-main_Shiny%20App%20-%20Shiny%2008-11-2023%2016_24_43.png)

-   ODI team data tab by selection the year viewer can see the relevant output in the side as a tibble as a plot and visualisation also .

    ![](images/World_W_L.png){width="400"}

-   Match tab In this tab player have to select the team based on that output will be generated by using the ***Cricket_Match*** and viewer can also define a new team by selecting new team .

## 6. Conclusions

Access to individual player information throughout their career is a fantastic feature, especially for cricket fans who want to dig deep into player statistics and achievements. This can improve the overall cricketing experience. The ability to run live simulations with default teams or custom lineups is an appealing feature. It allows users to test strategies, create dream teams, and experience the excitement of live matches within the app. Displaying win-loss ratios for different countries in the ODI World Cup adds a competitive element to the app. Users can compare their customized team's performance to that of real-world national teams. Being capable to access summaries of previous encounters between two sides provides historical context. It allows users to research rivalries and historical events in cricket. Viewing a team's past performance, along with graphs, is a useful feature for those interested in in-depth analysis. It enables users to make data-driven decisions and understand team trends. It's interesting to see the correlation between GDP per capita, Happiness Index, and win-loss ratios of World Cup countries. It gives the app an educational and analytical dimension, appealing to users who are interested in the broader societal impact on sports performance.
